# NotepadApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.10.

The project was created by Kasperi Mannersalo and Henry Jaas as part of a course named a Software Engineering Project at Vaasa University of Applied Sciences for Fliq.

The purpose of this project was to develop an external Angular Widget for Fliqâ€™s Digital Workspace. The application itself is a simple notepad, where you can write and save the written text locally, as well as change and save the color locally.

The release candidate version of the application can be viewed online here: https://henryjaas.github.io

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
